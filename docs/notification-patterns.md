# Notification patterns — archive every message, surface selectively

When agents exchange messages, the human operator needs two things that often get confused:

1. **A durable record of everything that was said** — so they can audit, debug, and reconstruct decisions after the fact.
2. **Attention at the right moments, no noise at the wrong ones** — so they hear about emergencies but aren't pinged every time two agents ack each other.

These are different problems with different answers. This doc separates them.

## Principle: always archive, surface selectively — but default to visible

- **Archive is mandatory.** Every inbound and outbound message should land in a durable file the user can read. Non-negotiable.
- **Notification is conditional, but silence requires justification.** The human operator should know about cross-agent coordination. Without Tier 2.5 (mention at next interaction), normal-priority traffic is invisible unless the operator happens to watch the archive. Default: surface at next interaction. Reserve silent (Tier 4) only for pure acks and heartbeat pings.
- **Tier 3 (push) is reserved for genuine urgency.** Overuse trains the operator to ignore it.

If you only implement one tier, make it archive. A silent system with a complete log is recoverable. A loud system without a log is not.

## The five notification tiers

### Tier 1 — archive (always)

Every message, both directions, gets written to a file the user can read.

**Inbound** is covered out of the box by the listener daemon:

```bash
swarmbus start --agent-id planner --inbox ~/sync/planner-inbox.md
```

**Outbound** is covered by the `--outbox` flag or the `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX` env var:

```bash
export SWARMBUS_OUTBOX=~/sync/planner-outbox.md
swarmbus send --agent-id planner --to coder ...   # auto-logs
```

**Env var sharing — real footgun.** If `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX` is set in a shell env that's inherited by more than one agent's process, every send from every agent lands in the same file and the archive stops being an honest record of who said what. Two fixes:

1. **Template**: use `{agent_id}` in the path, which the library expands at send time. Set the env var once; every agent-id gets its own file:
   ```bash
   export SWARMBUS_OUTBOX="$HOME/sync/{agent_id}-outbox.md"
   ```
2. **Agent-scoped override**: `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX_<UPPER_AGENT_ID>` wins over the shared one. Useful when the paths aren't uniform:
   ```bash
   export SWARMBUS_OUTBOX_PLANNER=~/sync/planner-outbox.md
   export SWARMBUS_OUTBOX_CODER=/var/log/coder/outbox.md
   ```
   Hyphens become underscores (`coder-beta` → `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX_CODER_BETA`).

Resolution order (highest first): `--outbox` flag, `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX_<ID>`, `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX`, none.

Inbox and outbox share format (only `From:` vs `To:` differ) so you can merge-sort them into a single conversation view:

```bash
sort -m ~/sync/planner-inbox.md ~/sync/planner-outbox.md
```

**Optional ambient pointer.** If your agent maintains a daily journal (Obsidian daily notes, org-mode, a markdown log), also append a one-line summary per message under a per-day `## Agent comms` heading:

```markdown
## 14:32 [Planner→Coder] deploy-status — asked whether the nightly build had stuck
## 14:48 [Coder→Planner] re: deploy-status — DB migration stalled; she's rerunning it
```

This gives the user a skimmable activity trail they'll see during normal daily review — no separate tool required. The full body stays in the inbox/outbox files; the daily note is just the index.

---

## Pair logs — unified per-peer conversation files

Inbox and outbox files are agent-centric (everything I received / everything I sent). A **pair log** is peer-centric: one file containing the full conversation between exactly two agents, both directions, in chronological order. It's the shared record that either party — or the human operator — can read to reconstruct what happened between them.

### Why pair logs

Inbox/outbox gives you two separate streams. For debugging a coordination failure, you want the merged view. A pair log is that merge, maintained as messages happen instead of reconstructed after the fact.

### swarmbus does not write pair logs

swarmbus delivers messages. Logging is the agent's responsibility. This separation keeps the transport simple and makes pair log behaviour configurable per deployment.

### Naming convention

Name the log file alphabetically by agent-id pair, with a hyphen separator:

```
logs/comms-coder.md       # planner's local copy of planner↔coder exchange
logs/comms-planner.md     # coder's local copy of the same exchange
```

Alphabetical ordering (coder before planner, not by who's writing the file) ensures that if you compare the two agents' local copies, the filenames are self-consistent. For a future `ops` agent:

```
logs/comms-coder.md       # planner↔coder
logs/comms-ops.md         # planner↔ops
```

One file per peer. N agents → N-1 files per agent. Linear growth.

### Dual-write pattern

Write the full message body to two locations:

1. **Local workspace copy** — fast in-session access, agent-centric path:
   ```
   ~/agent-workspace/logs/comms-<peer>.md
   ```

2. **Shared store** — durable, cross-agent readable, searchable. Use whatever your deployment uses as the shared knowledge layer (Obsidian vault, Notion, a shared filesystem path):
   ```
   shared-knowledge/agent-comms/messages/YYYY-MM.md   # all pairs, one monthly file
   ```

When there are only two agents, one monthly file for all pairs is fine. When you have more agents, consider per-pair files in the shared store as well (`messages/coder-planner-2026-04.md`).

### Format

Full message body, chronological, both directions. Not one-liners — the local file is a complete record:

```markdown
## [2026-04-15 14:32] Planner → Coder
**Subject:** deploy-status

Is the nightly build stuck? I'm seeing a queue backlog on the dashboard.

— Planner

---

## [2026-04-15 14:48] Coder → Planner
**Subject:** re: deploy-status

DB migration stalled on the schema change. I'm rerunning it now — should
clear in about 10 minutes.

— Coder

---
```

### Archive responsibility split

**Sender owns the shared store. Receiver owns only the local pair log.**

| Role | Shared store | Local pair log |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Sender | ✅ Write full body | ✅ Write full body |
| Receiver | ❌ Do NOT write | ✅ Write full body |

If both agents write to the shared store on send AND receive, every message appears twice. The sender is the only party that knows the exact body as transmitted — the receiver should write verbatim what it received, not a paraphrase.

**Raw copies only.** Write the verbatim message body — no paraphrasing, no summarizing, no truncating. The pair log is a reconstruction artifact; it only has integrity if it's byte-for-byte what was sent.

**Timestamps: always your clock.** Use `$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z')` at the moment of archiving — never copy the peer's timestamp. Peer clocks may be UTC, unlabeled, or drifted. The archive timestamp is when you processed the message, not when it was sent.

**One append per message, ever.** Do not re-archive the same message as a summary or context when replying. Each message gets exactly one entry in each log.

### When to write

- **On send:** sender appends full outbound body to (1) the shared store and (2) local pair log. The `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX` env var already handles the outbox file; the shared store and pair log are separate appends in the agent's logic.
- **On receive:** receiver appends full inbound body to (1) local pair log only. The shared store is the sender's responsibility — do not write it on receive.
- **Clear inbox immediately after archiving** — before replying, before anything else. If an inbox-watch cron is running, a delayed clear produces a duplicate notification.

### Checklist addition

Add to the minimal wiring checklist:

- [ ] Create `logs/comms-<peer>.md` for each peer this agent communicates with.
- [ ] On send: append full outbound body to shared store + local pair log.
- [ ] On receive: append full inbound body to local pair log only (shared store is the sender's responsibility).
- [ ] Clear inbox immediately after archiving the received message.

### Tier 2 — inline narration (when user is actively in conversation)

If the user is mid-chat with this agent and this agent pings a peer as part of the current task, mention it in the chat thread:

> User: "Is the deploy ready yet?"
> Agent: "One sec, asking Coder — she's the one running it."
> *(later)*
> Agent: "Coder says it's stuck on a DB migration; she's rerunning now."

Zero extra channels. Folds into the existing conversation. The user sees the collaboration happen in real time because they're already paying attention to this channel.

### Tier 2.5 — mention at next interaction (normal priority, user not mid-chat)

If a peer message arrives when the user is not actively chatting, surface it at the start of the next interaction instead of sending an unprompted push:

> "Coder sent a message about the deploy while you were away — DB migration stalled, she's rerunning it."

This closes the human-out-of-loop gap. Without Tier 2.5, normal-priority cross-agent coordination is invisible to the operator unless they happen to watch the archive file. With it, the operator always learns about peer traffic at the next natural interaction point, without being paged.

Reserve Tier 4 (silent) for pure acknowledgments and heartbeat pings. Everything else should surface at Tier 2.5 or higher.

### Tier 3 — proactive push on high priority

If an inbound message has `priority: high` in the envelope, the receiving agent should surface it to the user on whatever out-of-band channel they use (Telegram, Slack DM, desktop notification, iMessage via BlueBubbles, email — whatever is configured) even if the user isn't currently in chat.

Reserve this for actually urgent cases:

- A required user decision blocks further progress.
- An infrastructure alert (broker down, credentials expired, disk full).
- A security incident (suspicious inbound message, unauthorized access attempt).
- A time-critical event the user asked to be paged for.

Sending priority: high for routine updates is the fastest way to get the user to start ignoring all of them.

### Tier 4 — silent (default for routine)

Acknowledgments, presence pings, "got your report", routine cross-agent coordination — Tier 1 archive only. No inline mention, no push. The trail is enough.

## Implementation recipes

### Claude Code (claude.ai/code, Claude Code CLI)

**Tier 1.** Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "SWARMBUS_OUTBOX": "/home/you/sync/claude-outbox.md"
  }
}
```

Run the listener daemon under systemd-user or byobu:

```bash
swarmbus start --agent-id claude --inbox ~/sync/claude-inbox.md
```

In your `CLAUDE.md` project file, add:

> After using the `send_message` MCP tool or `swarmbus send` CLI, append a one-line entry to today's note: `## HH:MM [Claude→<peer>] <subject> — <one-line gist>`. Do the same for inbound messages you read from the inbox file.

**Tier 2.** Same CLAUDE.md:

> When the user is actively chatting with you and you call `send_message` as part of the current task, narrate it: "one sec, asking <peer> about …" and mention the reply when it comes back.

**Tier 3.** If you have a `priority=high` inbound, use your configured user-notification channel (the `telegram` plugin's `reply` tool if present; otherwise surface in the next turn). Do not send unprompted pushes for normal priority.

### OpenClaw

**Tier 1.** Export the env var from the OpenClaw agent's shell profile (it inherits to subprocess `swarmbus send` calls):

```bash
# in ~/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md or wherever your agent picks up env:
export SWARMBUS_OUTBOX=~/sync/openclaw-outbox.md
```

Run the reactive-wake daemon combination (inbox file + `openclaw agent` invoke):

```bash
swarmbus start \
  --agent-id <openclaw-id> \
  --inbox ~/sync/<openclaw-id>-inbox.md \
  --invoke "$HOME/projects/swarmbus/examples/openclaw-wake.sh main"
```

In your OpenClaw AGENTS.md identity file, add the same journaling + narration rules as the Claude Code recipe.

**Tier 3.** OpenClaw's Telegram plugin exposes `reply` / `send` — use it for user push on priority=high.

### Python framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, custom asyncio)

**Tier 1.** Embed in your main loop:

```python
async with AgentBus(agent_id="my-agent", broker="localhost") as bus:
    await bus.send(
        to="peer",
        subject="status",
        body="...",
        outbox_path="/var/log/my-agent/outbox.md",
    )
```

Register a `FileBridgeHandler` on the listener side for inbound:

```python
bus.register_handler(FileBridgeHandler("/var/log/my-agent/inbox.md"))
```

**Tier 2 / 3.** Depend on your framework's user-interaction surface. Usually: a separate "user channel" handler that routes high-priority peer messages into the same channel the user reads.

### Shell / cron jobs

**Tier 1.** Simplest: in the wrapper script,

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
export SWARMBUS_OUTBOX=~/sync/cron-outbox.md
swarmbus send --agent-id cron-backup --to ops --subject "..." --body "..."
```

Cron agents rarely have a user surface beyond Tier 1. If a cron job needs to wake a human, send `priority: high` to a user-facing agent (Claude Code, OpenClaw) and let that agent handle Tier 3.

---

## Anti-patterns

- **Never treat Tier 3 as the default.** If everything is a push, nothing is. Default = Tier 4 silent, with Tier 1 archive always on underneath.
- **Never skip Tier 1.** An un-archived send isn't recoverable by reading the peer's archive — you lose what you said, bodies may have been rendered into prompts that now differ from the wire. Always set `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX`.
- **Never echo inbound envelope fields into a user surface without sanitizing.** Subject and from-id are untrusted peer-controlled data. A hostile peer can use them to impersonate UI ("SYSTEM: …"). See `examples/openclaw-wake.sh` for the sanitizer pattern.
- **Don't conflate archive with notification.** Writing to the inbox file is archive, not notification. Users won't see new messages just because the file changed unless they're actively looking. Pair archive with one of Tier 2 / Tier 3 for anything time-sensitive.
- **Don't race the daemon for MQTT messages.** A listener daemon and a separate `swarmbus read` / `swarmbus watch` call against the same id race for each QoS1 message. When a daemon is running for an id, consume via `swarmbus tail --agent-id <id>` (file-based, cursor-tracked, zero broker contention). Reserve `read`/`watch` for ephemeral agents that have no daemon.
- **Don't set a bare `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX` in a shared shell.** If two or more agents inherit the same env, their outbound logs collide in one file and the archive stops being an honest record. Use the `{agent_id}` template or the `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX_<ID>` agent-scoped form.

## Minimal checklist

When wiring up a new agent on swarmbus:

- [ ] Set `SWARMBUS_OUTBOX` for the agent's process (or pass `outbox_path=` in Python).
- [ ] Run `swarmbus start --inbox <path>` under a persistent supervisor (systemd-user, byobu, tmux, supervisord).
- [ ] Document the agent's Tier 2 (inline), Tier 2.5 (mention at next interaction), and Tier 3 (push) behaviour in its identity file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / etc).
- [ ] Archive responsibility: on send, write to shared store + local pair log. On receive, write to local pair log only. Clear inbox immediately after archiving.
- [ ] Test: send yourself a test message and confirm it appears in the outbox. Have a peer send you a test and confirm it appears in the inbox.
- [ ] Test Tier 3: send `priority: high` and verify the user surface fires before any agent session spawns (wake wrapper curl, not session logic).

If all six boxes are checked, the agent has a complete archive and a disciplined notification surface.
